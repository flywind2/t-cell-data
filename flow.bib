  abstract = "Traditional methods for flow cytometry (FCM) data processing rely
              on subjective manual gating. Recently, several groups have
              developed computational methods for identifying cell populations
              in multidimensional FCM data. The Flow Cytometry: Critical
              Assessment of Population Identification Methods (FlowCAP)
              challenges were established to compare the performance of these
              methods on two tasks: (i) mammalian cell population
              identification, to determine whether automated algorithms can
              reproduce expert manual gating and (ii) sample classification, to
              determine whether analysis pipelines can identify characteristics
              that correlate with external variables (such as clinical
              outcome). This analysis presents the results of the first FlowCAP
              challenges. Several methods performed well as compared to manual
              gating or external variables using statistical performance
              measures, which suggests that automated methods have reached a
              sufficient level of maturity and accuracy for reliable use in FCM

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The ImageStream system combines advances in CCD
              technologies with a novel optical architecture for high
              sensitivity and multispectral imaging of cells in flow. The
              sensitivity and dynamic range as well as a methodology for
              spectral compensation of imagery is presented. METHODS:
              Multicolored fluorescent beads were run on the ImageStream and a
              flow cytometer. Four single color fluorescent control samples of
              cells were run to quantify spectral overlap. An additional
              sample, labeled with all colors was run and compensated in six
              spectral channels. RESULTS: Analysis of empirical data for
              sensitivity and dynamic range matched theoretical predictions.
              The ImageStream system demonstrated fluorescence sensitivity
              comparable to a PMT-based flow cytometer. A methodology for
              addressing spectral overlap, individual pixel anomalies, and
              multiple imaging modalities was demonstrated for spectral
              compensation of K562 cells. Imagery is shown pre- and
              post-compensation. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike intensity measurements
              made with conventional flow cytometers, object size impacts both
              dynamic range and fluorescence sensitivity in systems that
              utilize pixilated detection. Simultaneous imaging of alternate
              modalities can be employed to increase fluorescent sensitivity.
              Effective compensation of complex multimode imagery spanning six
              spectral bands is accomplished in a semi-automated manner.",

              enabled the use of flow cytometry for high throughput screening,
              generating large complex data sets often in clinical trials or
              drug discovery settings. However, data management and data
              analysis methods have not advanced sufficiently far from the
              initial small-scale studies to support modeling in the presence
              of multiple covariates. RESULTS: We developed a set of flexible
              open source computational tools in the R package flowCore to
              facilitate the analysis of these complex data. A key component of
              which is having suitable data structures that support the
              application of similar operations to a collection of samples or a
              clinical cohort. In addition, our software constitutes a shared
              and extensible research platform that enables collaboration
              between bioinformaticians, computer scientists, statisticians,
              biologists and clinicians. This platform will foster the
              development of novel analytic methods for flow cytometry.
              CONCLUSION: The software has been applied in the analysis of
              various data sets and its data structures have proven to be
              highly efficient in capturing and organizing the analytic work
              flow. Finally, a number of additional Bioconductor packages

  abstract = "Recent technological developments in high-dimensional flow
              cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) have made it possible to
              detect expression levels of dozens of protein markers in
              thousands of cells per second, allowing cell populations to be
              characterized in unprecedented detail. Traditional data analysis
              by ``manual gating'' can be inefficient and unreliable in these
              high-dimensional settings, which has led to the development of a
              large number of automated analysis methods. Methods designed for
              unsupervised analysis use specialized clustering algorithms to
              detect and define cell populations for further downstream
              analysis. Here, we have performed an up-to-date, extensible
              performance comparison of clustering methods for high-dimensional
              flow and mass cytometry data. We evaluated methods using several
              publicly available data sets from experiments in immunology,
              containing both major and rare cell populations, with cell
              population identities from expert manual gating as the reference
              standard. Several methods performed well, including FlowSOM,
              X-shift, PhenoGraph, Rclusterpp, and flowMeans. Among these,
              FlowSOM had extremely fast runtimes, making this method
              well-suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large,
              high-dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop
              computer. These results extend previously published comparisons
              by focusing on high-dimensional data and including new methods
              developed for CyTOF data. R scripts to reproduce all analyses are
              available from GitHub
              (https://github.com/lmweber/cytometry-clustering-comparison), and
              pre-processed data files are available from FlowRepository
              (FR-FCM-ZZPH), allowing our comparisons to be extended to include
              new clustering methods and reference data sets. \copyright{} 2016
