               (Teff) or regulatory (Treg) T cells, the balance of which is
               crucial to prevent inflammation or autoimmunity. One approach to
               treat autoimmune disease is to modulate T cell differentiation
               to favor Treg over Teff cells. We examined the metabolite and
               metabolic gene expression profiles of the subsets and found that
               they have distinct metabolic requirements and programs. Teff
               have a high expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 as well
               as glucose metabolism genes and a high rate of glycolysis. In
               contrast, Treg instead have high expression of mitochondrial
               metabolism genes and low GLUT1 levels. The effect of metabolic
               differences to modulate the Teff:Treg balance can be tested
               directly via genetic modulation of GLUT1. In vitro, T cells from
               GLUT1 transgenic mice are more inflammatory than wildtype
               littermates. Alternatively, T cells from GLUT1 knockout mice are
               unable to increase glucose metabolism upon activation and have
               fewer Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells. Despite less total CD4+ T cells,
               these mice have normal natural and inducible Treg numbers. In a
               mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), deletion of
               GLUT1 in T cells inhibits IBD disease progression. The mice have
               less CD4+ T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and decreased
               inflammatory cytokine production than wildtype control T cells.

              systematically mapped the response of CD4+ T cells to a large
              number of input cytokine combinations that drive their
              differentiation. We find that, in response to varied input

              cytokines hierarchically influence the cell population, with

              transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of

              time-series and genetic knock-out information with such
              transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze

              otherwise quiescent antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells confer
              rapid protection upon reinfection with viral pathogens or, in the
              case of persistent viruses, help to maintain control of the
              infection. Depending on the type of virus, antigen-specific
              CD8(+) T cells have distinct traits, ranging from typical memory
              cell properties in the case of rapidly cleared viruses to
              immediate effector functions for persistent viruses. We here show
              that both the differentiation stage, defined by the expression of
              cell surface markers, such as CD45RA, CCR7, CD28, and CD27, and
              distinct expression levels of T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes)
              predict the functional profile of antigen-experienced CD8(+) T
              cells. Furthermore, virus-specific CD8(+) T cells targeting
              different respiratory syncytial virus-, influenza A virus-,
              Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV)-, and
              HIV-1-specific epitopes adopt distinct T-bet and Eomes expression
              patterns that appear to be installed early during the primary
              response. Importantly, the associations between surface
              phenotype, T-bet/Eomes expression levels, and the expression of
              markers that predict CD8(+) T-cell function change according to
              viral infection history, particularly against the background of
              HIV-1 and, to lesser extent, of human cytomegalovirus and/or
              Epstein-Barr virus infection. Thus, the functionality of human
              antigen-experienced CD8(+) T cells follows at least two
              dimensions, one outlined by the surface phenotype and another by
              the T-bet/Eomes expression levels, which are determined by
              previous or persistent viral challenges. IMPORTANCE: Functional
              human CD8(+) T-cell subsets have been defined using surface
              markers like CD45RA, CCR7, CD28, and CD27. However, the induction
              of function-defining traits, like granzyme B expression, is
              controlled by transcription factors like T-bet and Eomes. Here,
              we describe how T-bet and Eomes levels distinctly relate to the
              expression of molecules predictive for CD8(+) T-cell function in
              a surface phenotype-independent manner. Importantly, we found
              that central memory and effector memory CD8(+) T-cell subsets
              differentially express T-bet, Eomes, and molecules predictive for
              function according to viral infection history, particularly so in
              the context of HIV-1 infection and, to lesser extent, of latent
              EBV- and/or hCMV-infected, otherwise healthy adults. Finally, we
              show that the distinct phenotypes and T-bet/Eomes levels of
              different virus-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations are imprinted
              early during the acute phase of primary infection in vivo. These

              Th, Treg, and Tr1 cell subsets has not been fully characterized.
              Independent functional characterization of human Th1, Th2, Th17,
              T follicular helper (Tfh), Treg, and Tr1 cells has helped to
              define unique surface molecules, transcription factors, and
              signaling profiles for each subset. However, the adequacy of
              these markers to recapitulate the whole CD3+CD4+ T cell
              compartment remains questionable. In this study, we examined
              CD3+CD4+ T cell populations by single-cell mass cytometry. We
              characterize the CD3+CD4+ Th, Treg, and Tr1 cell populations
              simultaneously across 23 memory T cell-associated surface and
              intracellular molecules. High-dimensional analysis identified
              several new subsets, in addition to the already defined CD3+CD4+
              Th, Treg, and Tr1 cell populations, for a total of 11 Th cell, 4
              Treg, and 1 Tr1 cell subsets. Some of these subsets share markers
              previously thought to be selective for Treg, Th1, Th2, Th17, and

              cells have a central role in adaptive immunity, since they
              provide essential help for both cytotoxic T cell- and

              cells are required to maintain self-tolerance and to inhibit
              immune responses that could damage the host. Initially, two
              subsets of CD4(+) helper T cells were identified that secrete
              characteristic effector cytokines and mediate responses against
              different types of pathogens, i.e., IFN-$\gamma$ secreting Th1

               pTreg fate, we used somatic cell nuclear transfer to generate a
               transnuclear (TN) mouse carrying a monoclonal TCR from a pTreg
               (pTreg TN mice). We found that the pTreg TCR did not inevitably
               predispose T cells to become pTreg but instead allowed for
               differentiation of noninflammatory CD4+CD8$\alpha$$\alpha$+
               intraepithelial lymphocytes (CD4IELs) in the small intestine.
               Only when we limited the number of T cell precursors that

               for pTreg development. Despite bearing the same TCR, small
               intestine CD4IEL developed independently of precursor frequency.
               Both pTreg and CD4IEL development strictly depended on the
               resident microbiota. A single clonal CD4+ T cell precursor can
               thus give rise to two functionally distinct and anatomically
               segregated T cell subsets in a microbiota-dependent manner.

              (thymus-dependent) responsible for DTH, cytotoxicity, and

               third of the global population and is a major public health
               concern. Although T cells are essential in mediating protection
               against Mtb infection, they are often unable to sterilize
               infected tissues. One possible reason for an ineffective immune
               response is the onset of T cell exhaustion or dysfunction. T
               cell exhaustion is characterized by the progressive loss of T
               cell effector function accompanied by an increase in expression
               of inhibitory receptors. Here we show that during Mtb infection,
               T cells express the inhibitory molecules Tim3 and PD1, and T
               cells that express both Tim3 and PD1 have decreased IFN$\gamma$
               and TNF production. In addition, antibody blockade of Tim3
               improves T cell function and decreases bacterial burden. These
               results indicate that T cells are functionally exhausted during
               chronic Mtb infection and that blockade of inhibitory receptors
               can re-invigorate T cell function and improve the outcome of
               infection. Based on a possible role for CEACAM1 in the T cell
               inhibitory signal mediated by Tim3, we are currently performing
               experiments to determine how CEACAM1 affects host defense

              accompanied by cell cycle changes, interplay that is of central
              importance for immunity but is still incompletely understood.
              Here, we interrogate and quantitatively model how proliferation
              is linked to differentiation in CD4+ T cells. RESULTS: We perform
              ex vivo single-cell RNA-sequencing of CD4+ T cells during a mouse
              model of infection that elicits a type 2 immune response and
              infer that the differentiated, cytokine-producing cells cycle
              faster than early activated precursor cells. To dissect this
              phenomenon quantitatively, we determine expression profiles
              across consecutive generations of differentiated and
              undifferentiated cells during Th2 polarization in vitro. We
              predict three discrete cell states, which we verify by
              single-cell quantitative PCR. Based on these three states, we
              extract rates of death, division and differentiation with a
              branching state Markov model to describe the cell population
              dynamics. From this multi-scale modelling, we infer a significant
              acceleration in proliferation from the intermediate activated
              cell state to the mature cytokine-secreting effector state. We
              confirm this acceleration both by live imaging of single Th2
              cells and in an ex vivo Th1 malaria model by single-cell
              RNA-sequencing. CONCLUSION: The link between cytokine secretion
              and proliferation rate holds both in Th1 and Th2 cells in vivo
              and in vitro, indicating that this is likely a general phenomenon

              target cells by virtue of the release of cytotoxic molecules.
              Recently, a population of CD4+ T cells that conforms to the
              phenotype of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells has received increased
              recognition. These cytotoxic CD4+ T cells display constitutive
              expression of granzyme B and perforin at the protein level and
              mediate HLA class II-dependent killing of target cells. In
              humans, this cytotoxic profile is found within the human
              cytomegalovirus (hCMV)-specific, but not within the influenza- or
              Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD4+ T cell populations, suggesting
              that, in particular, hCMV infection induces the formation of
              cytotoxic CD4+ T cells. We have previously described that the
              transcription factor Homolog of Blimp-1 in T cells (Hobit) is
              specifically upregulated in CD45RA+ effector CD8+ T cells that
              arise after hCMV infection. Here, we describe the expression

              in cytotoxic CD4+ T cells and accumulation of Hobit+ CD4+ T cells
              after primary hCMV infection. The Hobit+ CD4+ T cells displayed
              highly overlapping characteristics with Hobit+ CD8+ T cells,
              including the expression of cytotoxic molecules, T-bet, and
              CX3CR1. Interestingly, $\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells that arise after
              hCMV infection also upregulate Hobit expression and display a
              similar effector phenotype as cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
              These findings suggest a shared differentiation pathway in CD4+,
              CD8+, and $\gamma$$\delta$+ T cells that may involve Hobit-driven

              suppressive activity. In the past decade, identifying naturally
              occurring IL-10-producing Treg cells was difficult due to the
              lack of suitable surface markers. More recently, lymphocyte
              activation gene 3 (LAG-3) is a CD4 homologue that has been
              identified as a marker for IL-10-producing Treg cells.
              CD4+CD25-LAG3+ T cells produce large amounts of IL-10 and

              Moreover, the combined expression of LAG-3 and CD49b identifies

              Recently, LAG-3 has gained more attention in the context of

              cellular turnover and longevity by quantifying deuterium dilution

              This longitudinal analysis showed that the memory pool originates
              from CD8 T cells that divided extensively during the first two
              weeks after infection and is maintained by quiescent cells that
              divide less than once every year (doubling time of over 450

              C57BL/6 mice congenic at the Ly-1 or Ly-5 locus, and allelic
              markers to discriminate host and donor, we showed that

              Transfer of purified Lyt-2+ or Lyt-2+ + L3T4+ thymocytes, which

              pattern of differentiation as that produced by dLy-1 cells, but
              was delayed by 4-5 d. Transferred dLy-1 thymocytes exhibited a
              limited capacity for self-renewal, and resulted in a single wave

              involved in tissue damage and fighting infection against

              third member of the T helper set, IL-17-producing CD4(+) T cells,

              immunity has most likely evolved to control and clear such
              infectious agents. CD4(+) T cells are the major players in the
              adaptive immune response to pathogens. Following recognition of
              pathogen-derived antigens na{\"\i}ve CD4(+) T cells differentiate
              into effectors which then control pathogen replication either
              directly by killing pathogen-infected cells or by assisting with
              generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) or pathogen-specific
              antibodies. Pathogen-specific effector CD4(+) T cells are highly
              heterogeneous in terms of cytokines they produce. Three major
              subtypes of effector CD4(+) T cells have been identified:
              T-helper 1 (Th1) cells producing IFN-$\gamma$ and TNF-$\alpha$,
              Th2 cells producing IL-4 and IL-10, and Th17 cells producing

              to differences in kinetics (differentiation, proliferation,
              death) of different effector T cell subsets (population
              plasticity). We also shortly review mathematical models aimed at

              manipulation of Tregs is subject to numerous clinical
              investigations including trials for adoptive Treg transfer. Since
              the number of naturally occurring Tregs (nTregs) is minute, it is
              highly desirable to develop a complementary approach of inducing
              Tregs (iTregs) from na{\"\i}ve T cells. Mouse studies exemplify
              the importance of peripherally induced Tregs as well as the
              applicability of iTreg transfer in different disease models. Yet,
              procedures to generate iTregs are currently controversial,
              particularly for human cells. Here we therefore comprehensively
              compare different established and define novel protocols of human
              iTreg generation using TGF-$\beta$ in combination with other
              compounds. We found that human iTregs expressed several Treg
              signature molecules, such as Foxp3, CTLA-4 and EOS, while
              exhibiting low expression of the cytokines Interferon-$\gamma$,
              IL-10 and IL-17. Importantly, we identified a novel combination
              of TGF-$\beta$, retinoic acid and rapamycin as a robust protocol
              to induce human iTregs with superior suppressive activity in
              vitro compared to currently established induction protocols.
              However, iTregs generated by these protocols did not stably
              retain Foxp3 expression and did not suppress in vivo in a
              humanized graft-versus-host-disease mouse model, highlighting the
              need for further research to attain stable, suppressive iTregs.
              These results advance our understanding of the conditions
              enabling human iTreg generation and may have important

              from a dynamic viewpoint can help in understanding how memory
              populations are maintained following pathogen exposure or
              vaccination. For example, a dynamic view resolves the apparent
              paradox between the relatively short lifespans of individual
              memory cells and very long-lived immunological memory by
              focussing on the persistence of clonal populations, rather than
              individual cells. Clonal survival is achieved by balancing
              proliferation, death and differentiation rates within and between
              identifiable phenotypic pools; such pools correspond broadly to
              sequential stages in the linear differentiation pathway. Each
              pool has its own characteristic kinetics, but only when
              considered as a population; single cells exhibit considerable
              heterogeneity. In humans, we tend to concentrate on circulating
              cells, but memory T cells in non-lymphoid tissues and bone marrow

              to the skin/blood discrepancy, with substantial overlap in

              However, our appreciation for the actual complexity of helper
              T-cell subsets continues unabated. Just as the Sami language of
              Scandinavia has 1000 different words for reindeer, immunologists
              recognize the range of fates available for a CD4(+) T cell is
              numerous and may be underestimated. Added to the crowded scene
              for helper T-cell subsets is the continuously growing family of
              innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), endowed with common effector
              responses and the previously defined 'master regulators' for
              CD4(+) helper T-cell subsets are also shared by ILC subsets.
              Within the context of this extraordinary complexity are
              concomitant advances in the understanding of transcriptomes and
              epigenomes. So what do terms like 'lineage commitment' and helper

              put all of this together in a coherent conceptual framework? It
              would be arrogant to assume that we have a sophisticated enough
              understanding to seriously answer these questions. Instead, we
              review the current status of the flexibility of helper T-cell
              responses in relation to their genetic regulatory networks and

               beinhaltet nur Experimente zu einem T-Zell-Subtyp, den

               nat{\"u}rliche Treg (nTreg) und induzierte Treg (iTreg) Zellen.
               Eine bisher unbeantwortete Frage lautet, welche
               subtyp-spezifischen gen-regulatorische Mechanismen die T-Zell
               Differenzierung steuern. Dazu werden in dieser Arbeit zwei
               spezifische Herausforderungen der Treg Forschung behandelt: (i)
               die Identifikation von Zelloberfl{\"a}chenmarkern zur
               Unterscheidung und Charakterisierung der Subtypen, sowie (ii)
               die Rekonstruktion von Treg-Zell-spezifischen
               gen-regulatorischen Netzwerken (GRN), die die
               Differenzierungsmechanismen beschreiben. Die implementierte
               Meta-Analyse kombiniert mehr als 150 Microarray-Experimente aus
               {\"u}ber 30 Studien in einem Datensatz. Dieser wird benutzt, um
               mittels Machine Learning Zell-spezifische Oberfl{\"a}chenmarker
               an Hand ihres Expressionsprofils zu identifizieren. Mit der in
               dieser Arbeit entwickelten Methode wurden 41 Genen extrahiert,
               von denen sechs Oberfl{\"a}chenmarker sind. Zus{\"a}tzliche

               Verwendung des erstellten Datensatzes 11 verschiedene
               Algorithmen und evaluieren die Ergebnisse mit Informationen aus
               Interaktionsdatenbanken. Die Evaluierung zeigt, dass die derzeit
               verf{\"u}gbaren Methoden nicht in der Lage sind den Wissensstand
               Treg-spezifischer, regulatorsicher Mechanismen zu erweitern.
               Abschlie{\ss}end pr{\"a}sentieren wir eine
               Datenintegrationstrategie zur Rekonstruktion von GRN am Beispiel
               von Th2 Zellen. Aus Hochdurchsatzexperimenten wird ein
               Th2-spezifisches GRN bestehend aus 100 Genen rekonstruiert.
               W{\"a}hrend 89 dieser Gene im Kontext der
               Th2-Zelldifferenzierung bekannt sind, wurden 11 neue

              decade, crucial immune functions were shown to be regulated by
              specific miRNAs. These 'immuno-miRs' regulate generic cell
              biological processes in T cells, such as proliferation and
              apoptosis, as well as a number of T-cell-specific features that
              are fundamental to the development, differentiation and function
              of T cells. In this review, we give an overview of the current
              literature with respect to the role of miRNAs at various stages
              of T-cell development, maturation, differentiation, activation
              and ageing. Little is known about the involvement of miRNAs in
              thymic T-cell development, although miR-181a and miR-150 have
              been implicated herein. In contrast, several broadly expressed
              miRNAs including miR-21, miR-155 and miR-17~92, have now been
              shown to regulate T-cell activation. Other miRNAs, including
              miR-146a, show a more T-cell-subset-specific expression pattern
              and are involved in the regulation of processes unique to that
              specific T-cell subset. Importantly, differences in the miRNA
              target gene repertoires of different T-cell subsets allow similar
              miRNAs to control different T-cell-subset-specific functions.
              Interestingly, several of the here described immuno-miRs have
              also been implicated in T-cell ageing and there are clear
              indications for causal involvement of miRNAs in immunosenescence.
              It is concluded that immuno-miRs have a dynamic regulatory role
              in many aspects of T-cell differentiation, activation, function
              and ageing. An important notion when studying miRNAs in relation
              to T-cell biology is that specific immuno-miRs may have quite

  abstract = "Memory CD8 T cells that circulate in the blood and are present in
              lymphoid organs are an essential component of long-lived T cell
              immunity. These memory CD8 T cells remain poised to rapidly
              elaborate effector functions upon re-exposure to pathogens, but
              also have many properties in common with naive cells, including
              pluripotency and the ability to migrate to the lymph nodes and
              spleen. Thus, memory cells embody features of both naive and
              effector cells, fuelling a long-standing debate centred on
              whether memory T cells develop from effector cells or directly
              from naive cells. Here we show that long-lived memory CD8 T cells
              are derived from a subset of effector T cells through a process
              of dedifferentiation. To assess the developmental origin of
              memory CD8 T cells, we investigated changes in DNA methylation
              programming at naive and effector cell-associated genes in
              virus-specific CD8 T cells during acute lymphocytic
              choriomeningitis virus infection in mice. Methylation profiling
              of terminal effector versus memory-precursor CD8 T cell subsets
              showed that, rather than retaining a naive epigenetic state, the
              subset of cells that gives rise to memory cells acquired de novo
              DNA methylation programs at naive-associated genes and became
              demethylated at the loci of classically defined effector
              molecules. Conditional deletion of the de novo methyltransferase
              Dnmt3a at an early stage of effector differentiation resulted in
              reduced methylation and faster re-expression of naive-associated
              genes, thereby accelerating the development of memory cells.
              Longitudinal phenotypic and epigenetic characterization of the
              memory-precursor effector subset of virus-specific CD8 T cells
              transferred into antigen-free mice revealed that differentiation
              to memory cells was coupled to erasure of de novo methylation
              programs and re-expression of naive-associated genes. Thus,
              epigenetic repression of naive-associated genes in effector CD8 T
              cells can be reversed in cells that develop into long-lived
              memory CD8 T cells while key effector genes remain demethylated,
              demonstrating that memory T cells arise from a subset of
              fate-permissive effector T cells.",

              Such antigen-independent homeostatic proliferation is mediated in
              part by the common gamma-chain cytokines IL-7 and IL-15. To
              further explore the mechanisms governing maintenance of effector
              functions in long-lived memory T cells during antigen-independent
              proliferation, human na{\"\i}ve and memory CD8 T cells can be

              are entering mainstream clinical practice. Despite encouraging
              results, some patients do not respond to current therapies. In
              part, this phenomenon has been associated with infusion of
              reduced numbers of early memory T cells. Herein, we report that
              AKT signaling inhibition is compatible with CAR and TCR
              retroviral transduction of human T cells while promoting a
              CD62L-expressing central memory phenotype. Critically, this
              intervention did not compromise cell yield. Mechanistically,
              disruption of AKT signaling preserved MAPK activation and
              promoted the intranuclear localization of FOXO1, a
              transcriptional regulator of T cell memory. Consequently, AKT
              signaling inhibition synchronized the transcriptional profile for
              FOXO1-dependent target genes across multiple donors. Expression
              of an AKT-resistant FOXO1 mutant phenocopied the influence of AKT
              signaling inhibition, while addition of AKT signaling inhibition
              to T cells expressing mutant FOXO1 failed to further augment the
              frequency of CD62L-expressing cells. Finally, treatment of
              established B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was superior
              using anti-CD19 CAR-modified T cells transduced and expanded in
              the presence of an AKT inhibitor compared with conventionally
              grown T cells. Thus, inhibition of signaling along the PI3K/AKT
              axis represents a generalizable strategy to generate large
              numbers of receptor-modified T cells with an early memory
              phenotype and superior antitumor efficacy.",

              key immune pathways and are associated with cellular properties
              and environmental exposure. We also observe increased
              sex-specific gene expression differences in neutrophils.
              Neutrophil-specific DNA methylation hypervariable sites are
              enriched at dynamic chromatin regions and active enhancers.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our data highlight the importance of transcriptional
              and epigenetic variability for the key role of neutrophils as the
              first responders to inflammatory stimuli. We provide a resource

              hypoxic inflammatory sites, suggesting that functions of some

              investigated how hypoxic conditions influence human T cell
              functions and found that, in contrast to naive and central memory
              T cells (TN and TCM), hypoxia enhances the proliferation,
              viability, and cytotoxic action of effector memory T cells (TEM).
              Enhanced TEM expansion in hypoxia corresponded to high
              hypoxia-inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1$\alpha$) expression and
              glycolytic activity compared with that observed in TN and TCM. We
              determined that the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH negatively regulates

              in the 3'-UTR region of HIF1A mRNA in glycolytically inactive TN
              and TCM. Conversely, active glycolysis with decreased GAPDH

              Mitochondria are metabolic organelles that actively transform

              imposes TM cell characteristics and enhances antitumor function.
              Our data suggest that, by altering cristae morphology, fusion in

  abstract = "Since the original identification of the T helper 17 (Th17)
              subset in 2005, it has become evident that these cells do not
              only contribute to host defence against pathogens, such as
              bacteria and fungi, but that they are also critically involved in
              the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. In contrast to the
              classic Th1 and Th2 cells, which represent rather stably
              polarized subsets, Th17 cells display remarkable heterogeneity
              and plasticity. This has been attributed to the characteristics
              of the key transcription factor that guides Th17 differentiation,
              retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor gamma
              (ROR$\gamma$). Unlike the 'master regulators' T-bet and GATA3
              that orchestrate Th1 and Th2 differentiation, respectively,
              ROR$\gamma$ controls transcription at relatively few loci in Th17
              cells. Moreover, its expression is not stabilized by positive
              feedback loops but rather influenced by environmental cues,
              allowing for substantial functional plasticity. Importantly, a
              subset of IL-17/IFN$\gamma$ double-producing Th17 cells was
              identified in both human and mouse models. Evidence is
              accumulating that these IL-17/IFN$\gamma$ double-producing cells
              are pathogenic drivers in autoimmune diseases, including
              rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel
              disease. In addition, IL-17/IFN$\gamma$ double-producing cells
              have been identified in disorders in which the role of
              autoimmunity remains unclear, such as sarcoidosis. The observed
              plasticity of Th17 cells towards the Th1 phenotype can be
              explained by extensive epigenetic priming of the IFNG locus in
              Th17 cells. In fact, Th17 cells display an IFNG chromatin
              landscape that is remarkably similar to that of Th1 cells. On the
              other hand, pathogenic capabilities of Th17 cells can be
              restrained by stimulating IL-10 production and
              transdifferentiation into IL-10 producing T regulatory type 1
              (Tr1) cells. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our
              knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in
              Th17 differentiation, heterogeneity and plasticity. We focus on
              transcriptional regulation of the Th17 expression program, the
              epigenetic dynamics involved, and how genetic variants associated
              with autoimmunity may affect immune responses through distal gene
              regulatory elements. Finally, the implications of Th17 cell

              cells is unclear. T cell differentiation originally was
              considered a dichotomy between Th1 and Th2 cells, with Th1 cells
              deemed culpable for autoimmune islet destruction. Now, multiple

              function to regulate signaling cascades, with the activation of T
              cells during an adaptive immune response being a classic example.
              Mounting evidence indicates that the modification of proteins by
              O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc), the only mammalian
              glycan found on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, helps regulate
              T cell activation. Yet, a mechanistic understanding of how
              O-GlcNAc functions in T cell activation remains elusive, partly
              because of the difficulties in mapping and quantifying O-GlcNAc
              sites. Thus, to advance insight into the role of O-GlcNAc in T
              cell activation, we performed glycosite mapping studies via
              direct glycopeptide measurement on resting and activated primary
              human T cells with a technique termed Isotope Targeted
              Glycoproteomics. This approach led to the identification of 2,219
              intact O-linked glycopeptides across 1,045 glycoproteins. A
              significant proportion (>45\%) of the identified O-GlcNAc sites
              lie in close proximity to or coincide with a known
              phosphorylation site, supporting the potential for PTM crosstalk.
              Consistent with other studies, we find that O-GlcNAc sites in T
              cells lack a strict consensus sequence. To validate our results,
              we employed gel shift assays based on conjugating mass tags to
              O-GlcNAc groups. Notably, we observed that the transcription
              factors c-JUN and JUNB show higher levels of O-GlcNAc
              glycosylation and higher levels of expression in activated T
              cells. Overall, our findings provide a quantitative
              characterization of O-GlcNAc glycoproteins and their
              corresponding modification sites in primary human T cells, which

  abstract = "It is well established that CD8(+) T cells constitute an
              important branch of adaptive immunity contributing to clearance
              of intracellular pathogens and providing long-term protection.
              These functions are mostly fulfilled by the best characterized
              subpopulation of CD8(+) T cells, the cytotoxic T lymphocytes
              (also called Tc1 cells), owing to their ability to kill infected
              cells and to secrete cytokines such as interferon-$\gamma$ and
              tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$. However, there is growing
              evidence for alternative CD8(+) T cell fates influencing CD4(+)
              T-cell-mediated responses in the context of allergy, autoimmunity
              and infections. Thus, like subpopulations of CD4(+) T cells, also
              CD8(+) T cells under particular conditions acquire the expression
              of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-13, IL-17 or suppressive
              activity and thereby influence immune responses. The process of
              CD8(+) T-cell differentiation is dictated by antigen strength,
              co-stimulatory molecules and cytokines. These environmental cues
              induce transcription factors further specifying CD8(+) T-cell
              decision into Tc1, Tc2, Tc9, Tc17 or CD8(+) T regulatory fate.
              Here, we discuss our current understanding about functional
              diversity of effector CD8(+) T cells and contribution of
              transcription factors to this process.",

  abstract = "A panel of antigen-specific mouse helper T cell clones was
              characterized according to patterns of lymphokine activity
              production, and two types of T cell were distinguished. Type 1 T
              helper cells (TH1) produced IL 2, interferon-gamma, GM-CSF, and
              IL 3 in response to antigen + presenting cells or to Con A,
              whereas type 2 helper T cells (TH2) produced IL 3, BSF1, and two
              other activities unique to the TH2 subset, a mast cell growth
              factor distinct from IL 3 and a T cell growth factor distinct
              from IL 2. Clones representing each type of T cell were
              characterized, and the pattern of lymphokine activities was
              consistent within each set. The secreted proteins induced by Con
              A were analyzed by biosynthetic labeling and SDS gel
              electrophoresis, and significant differences were seen between
              the two groups of T cell line. Both types of T cell grew in
              response to alternating cycles of antigen stimulation, followed
              by growth in IL 2-containing medium. Examples of both types of T
              cell were also specific for or restricted by the I region of the
              MHC, and the surface marker phenotype of the majority of both
              types was Ly-1+, Lyt-2-, L3T4+, Both types of helper T cell could
              provide help for B cells, but the nature of the help differed.
              TH1 cells were found among examples of T cell clones specific for
              chicken RBC and mouse alloantigens. TH2 cells were found among
              clones specific for mouse alloantigens, fowl gamma-globulin, and
              KLH. The relationship between these two types of T cells and
              previously described subsets of T helper cells is discussed.",
