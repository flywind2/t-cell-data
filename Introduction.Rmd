## Basic T cell biology
To learn or review basic information about the biology of the adaptive immune system and T cells, the following freely available book chapters may be helpful.

**Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 24: The Adaptive Immune System**

- [Lymphocytes and the Cellular Basis of Adaptive Immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26921/)
- [T Cells and MHC Proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26926/)
- [Helper T Cells and Lymphocyte Activation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26827/)

**Immunobiology, Chapter 8: T Cell-Mediated Immunity**

- [The production of armed effector T cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27118/)
- [General properties of armed effector T cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27149/)
- [T cell-mediated cytotoxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27101/)
- [Macrophage activation by armed CD4 TH1 cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27153/)

## Building intuition
Here's a picture of activated vs. unactivated T cells from [@Jung2016-al].

```{r sem, fig.align='center', fig.cap='SEM images of resting (A) and effector (B) peripheral blood human T cells. (White scale bars: 1 Î¼m.)', echo=FALSE}

```

TCRs are found in the squiggles. They are x size.

Here's the proportion in circulating blood. Here's how many come from the thymus per day. Here's how long they live.

## History of T cell subsets
In 1975, Harvey Cantor and Edward Boyse established the distinction between what we would call today CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [@Cantor1975-le]. For a review, see [@Chess2006-jt].

In 1986, CD4+ T cells were further subdivided into Th1 and Th2 cells [@Mosmann1986-hy]. For reviews, see [@Liew2002-pq] and [@McGhee2005-dq].

A more complex chapter in the history of T cell subsets involves T suppressor cells and T regulatory (Treg) cells. For reviews of this topic, see [@Shevach2011-aj] and [@Bluestone2017-mw].

In 2003, Th17 cells [@Aggarwal2003-fz] were identified as distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells. For a review, see [@Basso2009-fv].

In 1999, the distinction between effector memory (Tem) and central memory (Tcm) T cells was established by Sallusto, Lanzavecchia, and colleagues [@Sallusto1999-ea]. For more recent reviews, see [@Sallusto2004-ch] and [@Kaech2014-fm]).

Recently it's become clear that these subsets may be better thought of as traits. For example, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells can both be divided into Tem and Tcm, and there exist CD8+ Tregs and CD4+ cytotoxic T cells. Some authors even claim CD8+ T cells can be divided into Tc1, Tc2, and Tc17 subsets that correspond to the CD4+ Th1, Th2, and Th17 subsets [@Mittrucker2014-eg].
