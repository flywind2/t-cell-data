## Basic T cell biology
To learn or review basic information about the biology of the adaptive immune system and T cells, the following freely available book chapters may be helpful.

**Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 24: The Adaptive Immune System**

- [Lymphocytes and the Cellular Basis of Adaptive Immunity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26921/)
- [T Cells and MHC Proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26926/)
- [Helper T Cells and Lymphocyte Activation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26827/)

**Immunobiology, Chapter 8: T Cell-Mediated Immunity**

- [The production of armed effector T cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27118/)
- [General properties of armed effector T cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27149/)
- [T cell-mediated cytotoxicity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27101/)
- [Macrophage activation by armed CD4 TH1 cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27153/)

## Building intuition
Here's a picture of activated vs. unactivated T cells from [@Jung2016-al].

```{r sem, fig.align='center', fig.cap='SEM images of resting (A) and effector (B) peripheral blood human T cells. (White scale bars: 1 Î¼m.)', echo=FALSE}

```

TCRs are found in the squiggles. They are x size.

Here's the proportion in circulating blood. Here's how many come from the thymus per day. Here's how long they live.

## T cell subsets
n 1975, Harvey Cantor and Edward Boyse established the distinction between what we would call today CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [@Cantor1975-le].
